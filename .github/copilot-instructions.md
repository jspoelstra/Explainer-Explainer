## Context
This repository contains a Python jupyter notebook that demonstrates how to generate plausible causal factors for a given outcome variable using a simple naive Bayes approach where each feature is modeled as a logistic regression, normalized so that the regression predicts log of *relative* odds.

## Code Style and Conventions
- Use PEP 8 style guide for Python code.
- Always use f-strings for string formatting.
- Always add Markdown cells to notebooks before adding corresponding code cells.
- Allways add all the code needed to complete a step in a single cell, unless multiple code cells for a single step are needed for better readability.
